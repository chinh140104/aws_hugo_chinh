In today's digital landscape, businesses face increasingly complex security challenges: managing multiple security tools, handling vendor relationships, and maintaining internal security expertise—all while still operating their core business functions.

Managed Security Service Providers (MSSPs) help address these challenges by providing comprehensive security solutions that transform how organizations approach cloud security. As a single point of contact, they coordinate multiple security capabilities, from native AWS services to industry-leading security tools.

To support these evolving needs, we're excited to introduce new categories for the [AWS MSSP Competency](https://aws.amazon.com/mssp/partner-solutions/) (formerly AWS Level 1 MSSP Competency), designed to help customers easily identify Partners with security expertise based on their specific requirements. The new MSSP Competency categories validate the capability of Service Partners to deliver turnkey outcomes incorporating native AWS services, and the ability of Software Partners to integrate with native AWS services.

In addition to core MSSP requirements, each AWS MSSP Competency Partner must select and meet requirements for at least one category. This allows Partners to demonstrate deep technical expertise in specific security domains, differentiate themselves in the marketplace, and better connect with customers seeking their particular security strengths.

Additionally, MSSP Competency Partners have the option to showcase how they integrate validated ISV solutions from [AWS Security Competency Partners](https://aws.amazon.com/security/partner-solutions/?blog-posts-cards.sort-by=item.additionalFields.createdDate&blog-posts-cards.sort-order=desc&partner-case-studies-cards.sort-by=item.additionalFields.sortDate&partner-case-studies-cards.sort-order=desc&events-master-partner-webinars.sort-by=item.additionalFields.startDateTime&events-master-partner-webinars.sort-order=asc&apn-tv-cards.sort-by=item.dateCreated&apn-tv-cards.sort-order=desc) into their managed security service. This level of visibility helps AWS customers identify which MSSP Competency Partners can effectively manage their existing third-party security tools as part of a comprehensive security solution.

AWS MSSP Competency Partners are validated for their ability to provide end-to-end security management, maintaining strong security posture through continuous monitoring, advanced threat detection, and incident response. These partners ensure robust security while enabling businesses to focus on core operations.

## **New! AWS MSSP Competency Categories**

The AWS MSSP Competency categories help customers identify validated Partners with expertise who can deliver comprehensive security outcomes with quality, speed, and cost efficiency.

### **Infrastructure Security**

Focuses on managing the security posture of foundational infrastructure components through leading controls for vulnerability management, configuration security, and patch management. Includes network layer protection through proactive Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection, network threat prevention, and network access control, along with deploying and managing network segmentation strategy including segment isolation, micro-segmentation, and network policy management.

### **Workload Security**

Provides turnkey security at the workload level, specifically for containers or hosts. Services are validated for their ability to provide cloud infrastructure vulnerability management for workloads, host-based security, container security, and serverless security.

### **Application Security**

Provides operational security for the application layer within AWS environments through application vulnerability management, API security, managed Web Application Firewall, and pipeline security.

### **Data Protection**

Helps protect customer data through comprehensive data security programs to prevent data loss, deploy and manage encryption strategy, discover sensitive data in their environments, and manage data access permissions.

### **Identity & Access Management**

Provides turnkey Identity & Access Management (IAM) solutions through guided identity governance, aligned with customer business needs. Partners deploy and manage authentication controls aligned with that governance, manage and monitor privileged accounts, and secure temporary and just-in-time elevated access.

### **Incident Response**

Creates incident response preparation plans, identifies key stakeholders in case of incidents, and provides tabletop exercises for preparation. Includes incident investigation, classification, and remediation, along with post-incident analysis and forensic investigation.

### **Cyber Recovery**

Operationalizes rapid recovery from security events through cyber business continuity planning, backup management programs, ransomware protection, and cyber disaster recovery planning and execution.
