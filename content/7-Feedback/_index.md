### General Assessment

**1. Working Environment**  
The working environment in the FCJ program is very professional and supportive. The learning and working spaces are well-organized, helping me focus and absorb knowledge effectively. The workshops held at the AWS office gave me the feeling of working in a real-world environment.

**2. Support from Mentors / Team Admin**  
Mentors and team admin are always enthusiastic in their support. They answer all questions in detail and encourage independent thinking and self-learning. I particularly appreciate how mentors share practical experiences and provide career development guidance.

**3. Alignment between Work and Academic Major**  
The training content is highly relevant to my Information Technology major. Workshops on Cloud, AI/ML, and DevOps closely follow current technology trends, allowing me to apply what I've learned while acquiring new skills.

**4. Learning Opportunities & Skill Development**  
I have learned many important skills: from technical ones (using AWS services) to soft skills (teamwork, presentation, report writing). The opportunity to attend sharing sessions from experts and alumni has been invaluable.

**5. Culture & Team Spirit**  
The culture at FCJ is very open and encourages learning. Everyone in the program is always ready to support each other. I truly feel the spirit of "sharing to grow together" among all participants.

**6. Policies / Benefits for Interns**  
The program provides excellent support for students, from offering AWS accounts for hands-on practice to organizing networking events with businesses. The small gifts during each workshop also provide great motivational boosts.

### Additional Questions

- **What are you most satisfied with during your internship?**  
I'm most satisfied with the opportunity to access the latest technologies (AI/ML, GenAI) and learn from top experts. The chance to practice directly on AWS has significantly boosted my confidence.

- **What do you think the program could improve for future interns?**  
Perhaps adding a few more workshops (mini-projects) to apply all the knowledge learned comprehensively. This would help students gain deeper understanding of how services connect in real-world scenarios.

- **Would you recommend this program to friends? Why?**  
Absolutely! This is a high-quality, free program that offers tremendous practical value for IT students. Not only do you learn about technology, but you also get to connect with the community and explore career opportunities.

### Suggestions & Expectations

- **Would you like to continue with this program in the future?**  
Yes, very much! I hope there will be more advanced or specialized programs in specific fields to continue my development.

- **Other comments (free to share):**  
I would like to thank the organizers, mentors, and everyone involved for creating such a meaningful program. This has truly been an important stepping stone for my future career development journey.
