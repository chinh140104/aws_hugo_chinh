### Highlights & Key Learnings

#### 1. Vision from AWS & Career Direction
- **AWS First Cloud Journey**: The program aims not only to train skills but to cultivate a **generation of AWS Builders** for Vietnam, ready for the digital transformation wave.
- **Clear Learning Path**: The OJT program provides hands-on training from cloud fundamentals (AWS Cloud Practitioner) to specialized areas (Solutions Architect, DevOps, AI/ML).
- **Strong Community**: Students are connected to the **AWS Study Group** with over 47,000 members – an invaluable resource for learning and support.

#### 2. Practical Insights from Industry: What is DevOps?
- **DevOps is More Than Tools**: Mr. Đỗ Huy Thắng (VNG) emphasized that DevOps is about **culture and process** that bridges Development and Operations, aiming for faster and more stable product releases.
- **Essential Skills**: Beyond AWS knowledge, Git, and CI/CD; **communication, problem-solving, and self-learning** abilities are critical for career growth.

#### 3. Inspiring Journeys from Alumni
- **From FCJ to GenAI Engineer**: Mr. Hiếu Nghị shared his journey from being an FCJ student, continuous self-learning, to seizing opportunities in Generative AI – demonstrating **career evolution** in tech.
- **She in Tech**: Ms. Linh Nhi inspired attendees about **overcoming stereotypes** and confidently pursuing technical passions, highlighting diversity and equal opportunity in the industry.
- **A Day in the Life of a Cloud Engineer**: Mr. Hải Anh described real daily tasks: reviewing architecture, writing Infrastructure as Code (Terraform), troubleshooting, and cost optimization, helping students **visualize** their future roles.
- **Lesson on Proactivity**: Mr. Thanh Hiệp stressed that opportunities don't come automatically. **Proactively seeking opportunities** (like applying to FCJ), **persistent learning**, and **connecting with mentors** were key to his success.

### Key Takeaways

#### For Personal Direction
- **Define Clear Goals**: The FCJ program is a launchpad, but each individual needs to chart their own path (toward Solutions Architect, DevOps Engineer, AI Engineer, etc.).
- **Importance of Mindset**: A growth mindset, readiness for challenges, and continuous learning are more important than knowing a specific tool.

#### For Professional Skills
- **Soft Skills are Crucial**: Communication, teamwork, and presentation skills were mentioned by all speakers as indispensable.
- **Theory Must Meet Practice**: Classroom knowledge is foundational; real value comes from **building actual projects**, participating in competitions, and gaining internship experience.

#### For Opportunities & Networking
- **Value of Networking**: The event was a golden opportunity to connect with seniors who could become mentors or referrals in the future.
- **Community Support**: Learning to leverage the AWS Study Group and official program support channels is essential to avoid feeling "lost" during the learning journey.

### Personal Action Plan After the Event
1.  **Create a Detailed Study Plan**: Based on the OJT roadmap, develop a personal schedule to obtain the **AWS Cloud Practitioner** certification within the next 2 months.
2.  **Proactive Networking**: Connect on LinkedIn with the speakers and alumni who shared their stories, and actively participate in discussions within the AWS Study Group.
3.  **Build a Portfolio**: Start a small personal project (e.g., deploying a static website to AWS S3) to immediately apply learned knowledge and enhance my CV.
4.  **Develop Soft Skills**: Register for workshops on presentation and teamwork skills organized by the University's Youth Union.

### Personal Experience at the Event

Attending the Kick-off event on the 26th floor of Bitexco Tower was a memorable and inspiring experience. The professional atmosphere, from registration and check-in to the speakers' presentations, made me feel like I was truly stepping into an industry environment.

**The most profound impression came from the alumni sharing sessions.** Listening to Mr. Hiếu Nghị recount his journey from an FCJ student to a GenAI Engineer, and Ms. Linh Nhi share the challenges and successes of women in Tech, made me realize that **the path ahead is entirely achievable with enough determination.** These stories were far more relatable and tangible than theoretical lectures.

The Q&A session was also highly valuable, as my peers and I received direct answers to questions about the curriculum, internship opportunities, and necessary skills. The group photo with all OJT students and the organizers concluded a meaningful morning, leaving a feeling of **excitement and readiness** for the upcoming journey.

In summary, the event not only provided information but also **ignited passion and confidence** within me. I feel grateful for this opportunity and am committed to maximizing the AWS First Cloud Journey program for my personal development.
